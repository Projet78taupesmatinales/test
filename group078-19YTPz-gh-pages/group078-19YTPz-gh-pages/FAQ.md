## FAQ: 

## Should we make repository ourselves?
 You are not supposed to create a new repository (your questions are about creating repositories). You simply need to upload your stuff on the repository we have created for you and for which you received the invitation 

## Should we put our project in public or private mode?
Please keep the repositories in private mode.

## We have already created our own website, do we have to do it all over again?
In that case, you only need to keep one home page on this platform containing a short introduction of your project and a link to your own website. 

In order to appear in the catalogue of all the projects, don't forget to change the title, subtitle, description as well as the cover photo and logo.

## What if I make some changes or completely delete the tutorial and cheatsheet pages?
No worries. You can always find a fresh version of the website [https://thegreattransition.github.io/group00](here).

## What if I mistakenly delete all of the files within a folder (resulting in the disappearance of that folder)? 
Just go to the parent folder, click on “Create new file”, you should exactly put the correct name for that folder and at the end put `/` (your folder is made now) and then name your file. For example `images/logo`.

Finally scroll down and click on commit new file. In this way, you have one folder which includes one file. 

## What are the optimal dimensions for cover and logo?
For the cover photo 1500x500 pixels

For the logo 300x300 pixels

## Which software is easier to create a personalized cover that respects the size displayed on the site?
No software needed. You can simply use [https://resizeimage.net/](https://resizeimage.net/) to resize your images.

## If our work is in a pdf format, should we simply upload them or rewrite their content on the website?
It's your choice how you want to utilize the different features of this platform. You just go to assets and upload your pdf there, then use it in any page of the website.
